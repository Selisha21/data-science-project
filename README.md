### Hello Everyone, I'm Selisha Shrestha. Let me share some highlights from my project:
#### 1. Ads: This project dives into predicting sales using machine learning tricks. Follow along with the notebook to uncover how different factors and algorithms influence sales forecasts.
#### 2. Missing Values:  Learn how to deal with the missing data in this project. I compared Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine methods for classification tasks.
#### 3. Pima Diabetes Prediction: Forecasting Diabetes Onset: In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to predict when diabetes might develop based on diagnostic data. We work with the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle, creating visualizations to show dataset traits, feature significance, and model performance. We also analyze evaluation metrics to gauge how well our models perform.
#### 4. Water Potability: Using machine learning, we predict water quality by applying logistic regression and random forest classifier methods. This project showcases how machine learning can accurately predict water quality, offering valuable insights for public health and environmental conservation efforts.
